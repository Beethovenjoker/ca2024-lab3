## HackMD
- [Assignment3: Construct a RISC-V CPU with Chisel](https://hackmd.io/GjRf9hc2TO-kp-mcsJXISw)
## Development Objectives

Our goal is to create a RISC-V CPU that prioritizes simplicity while assuming a foundational understanding of digital circuits and the C programming language among its readers. The CPU should strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication, and we intend to maximize its functionality. This project encompasses the following key aspects, which will be prominently featured in the technical report:
* Implementation in Chisel.
* RV32I instruction set support.
* Execution of programs compiled from the C programming language.
* Successful completion of RISC-V Architectural Tests, also known as riscv-arch-test.
